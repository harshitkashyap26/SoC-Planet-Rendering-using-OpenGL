Option 1: Using Visual Studio(Better)
If you have Visual Studio installed on your system, go to the OpenGLVS folder and run the OpenGLVS.sln solution file on VS.
Next, open the existing MainLite.cpp in the project and build it. Simple.

Option 2: Using Makefile
Go to the Executable MakeFile folder and follow the instructions inside.
