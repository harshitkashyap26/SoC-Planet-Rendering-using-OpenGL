The code will render Earth at origin rotating around its axis, and the Sun will be rotating around the Earth. (From the
frame of reference of Earth, its actually the Earth rotating around the Sun in reality). The part of Earth facing the Sun
will have day time while the other part will have nightime. The Earth is also surrounded by cloudy atmosphere.

Important Note: The rendering uses very high quality cubemaps, so it may take some time to open the first time. A white
screen may be visible for the time it will take to render, usually around 10 seconds. But again it depends on the specs
of your system
